Some notes about the data in this folder:

- The score found in spearman_score_table.csv is computed as follows:

score = $2 \* wins + ties$

Where a win is any time the spearman difference is greater than 0, and a tie occurs when the spearman difference is not significant (see spearman_results.csv)
